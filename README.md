# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew.

🎮 I'm a data analyst and software developer with aspirations to work in the games industry.

🛠️ I'm currently using Godot to build an [asynchronous auto battler](https://github.com/andrewdlanham/untitled-auto-battler) inspired by TFT and Super Auto Pets. 

📊 Professionally, I work with tools like SQL, Python, and Microsoft's Power Platform to create data-driven reports, and business applications.

✉️ Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or email me at andrewdlanham@gmail.com!
