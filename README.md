# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew.

🎮 I'm a data analyst and software developer with aspirations to work in the games industry.

🛠️ I'm currently using Godot to build an asynchronous auto battler inspired by TFT and Super Auto Pets. [Check it out ->](https://github.com/andrewdlanham/untitled-auto-battler)

📊 Professionally, I work with SQL, Python, Microsoft's Power Platform, and several other tools to create automated processes, data-driven reports, and business applications.
