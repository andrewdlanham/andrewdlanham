# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew.

🎮 I'm a data analyst and software developer with aspirations to work in the games industry.

🛠️ I'm currently using Godot to build an [asynchronous auto battler](https://github.com/andrewdlanham/untitled-auto-battler) inspired by TFT and Super Auto Pets. 

📊 Professionally, I work with tools like SQL, Python, and Power Apps to create data-driven reports and business applications.

✉️ Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out via email at andrewdlanham@gmail.com to chat about opportunities!
